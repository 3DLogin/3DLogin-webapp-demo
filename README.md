3DLogin-webapp-demo
===================

This web application example allows an admin to learn how to integrate 3dlogin on their website. It is a beta version, but this release supports all the social connect features of 3DLogin and it should be possible to do real work with it.

This example implements the relevant calls to the 3DLogin web services. To use the demo without modification, you will need to create an account with 3DLogin. You can create a free 3DLogin account by going to the account creation page ( http://3dlogin.com/account ). Once you create an account, you will need to copy the configuration data found on your API Profile page into  3dlogin.php file. 

If you’re stuck and need additional assistance, please don’t hesitate to contact us via email (info@3dlogin.com). This Demo is an excellent place to share thoughts, integration problems, and projects with other users.
